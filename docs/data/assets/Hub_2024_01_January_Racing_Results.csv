Coalman Jack showed great early pace off an unsuitable inside draw at Warrnambool last start. He courses very wide in his races and even though he exploded out last start, when he habitually went to shift off the track there was another dog there and he lost some momentum.

Speedy Scrub has started her career in good fashion. The daughter of Fernando Bale has recorded one win and three placings in five starts including a personal best of 30.67 over track and trip. While this time doesn’t jump off the paper, this race appears well within her grasp. Her lone win was out of box three and she has the speed to hold out the likes of Cleopatra Hayze and No Ordinary Gal.

Indiana Wind is racing in a rich vein of form and can add another win to her resume on Thursday night. The daughter of Zipping Garth has been a prolific winner having won 10 of her 22 starts to date. She made her Albion Park 520m debut two starts ago when leading all of the way from box one to score by four lengths in 30.32. Since then, She wasn’t disgraced in a heat of the QLD Futurity where she failed to cross from box six and wound up fifth. Jumping back into box one appears the key to success considering she’s won three of her five attempts. Expect her to relish the drop in grade and prove hard to run down.

Sorority has been racing consistently over shorter distances and appears well suited stepping up to the staying trip. The daughter of Konomi won two starts ago over the 600m at Albion Park in a heat of the Golden Sands. She displayed good strength on this occasion, getting the better of Nangar Lucy late in the piece. Subsequently drew the squeeze box in the final and was only fair. She will enter this race on the fresh side and with box eight she will get the time and space required to sweep across this field.

Final heat of the Golden Ticket and it’s the West Aussie who peaks our interest. Group one winner Saige Tenniele trialled super in the lead up to her failed attempt at Golden Sands glory. Since then, she has finished last, beaten a fair way by Professor Snitch. Despite her poor form on paper she appears to be best suited to this format. She has frequently trialled fast wherever she has travelled and with a vacant box either side of her as well as both Oh Minnie and Another Chance likely to clear her with ease, she will get the drop in third position.

Nangar Nellie has raced well since arriving in QLD with two consecutive placings in a heat of the futurity and final. Despite this, both those runs came from box six and she now exits from box two which appears to be a negative due to her wanting to get off the track on the first turn. Jen’s Joy outside her began well last start and crashed hard left which throw’s another spanner into the works. Expect Nangar Nellie to be on the back foot early and to have too great a task.

Many of these dogs were in last week’s maiden 1000 heats which has to be the right form for Wednesday’s maiden. Showtime Hunter hails from leading trainer Ken Boody’s kennel and showed glimpses of talent on debut. He only began fairly and just as he was going to accelerate he checked off heels and was relegated to the rear of the field. Despite finishing sixth of seven and six lengths off the leader, the run had more merit. He’s drawn well in box three with a seemingly wide runner outside him and two average beginners inside. Expect him to be a different dog if he finds the arm.

If he misses that dog he’ll need to get around the likes of Five Putt Call, Rough Sea, Sketchy Deliver and Candyman who all map to be in-front of him.

It might seem strange to want to Lay a dog that has won his last 10 starts but these wins  have been in much easier races at Dubbo and Wagga.

Cane Smoke will be looking to break his maiden tag on Wednesday night. The son of Whiskey Riot has raced twice over this track and trip without having much joy. On debut he began fairly and was instantly run off the track by dogs drawn underneath. His second start was much the same. He gets the benefit of box one and can make use of a favourable map with a quick beginning. Both Joy Sure Can and Sweet Lollipop drawn outside him are risky beginners who like to shift off the track which will allow Cane Smoke the time and space required to lead this race.

Bossy Miss Bliss appears capable of turning the tables on Cosmo Sterling. The daughter of Fernando Bale hails from an extremely successful litter and she showed her true ability two starts ago when returning from a three month break with an outstanding victory over track and trip. She drew box seven last start and was unable to cross her inside competitors. Despite this, she never gave up as she hit the line well for third. She will be better suited to the low draw and she has the speed to kick through underneath her main rival in Cosmo Sterling.

Admittedly, Rolls Ripple has been racing in terrific form since relocating to Rockhampton; however, he appears under the odds in this contest. He was on the fresh side last week being almost four weeks in-between runs which helped him with a quick beginning. Once he found the front, he was never getting caught and he is a dog who is capable of running the hands off the clock. With all this, he is being priced on what he did last week rather than what’s in-front of him this week. I don’t expect him to jump as cleanly and from there, he is going to need luck coming through a pack.

He has sizzled around both the 315m and 460m at Bundaberg as well as the 395m at Albion Park.

More Peaches returned from a two month break last week when finishing fourth of five in the best eight sprint behind Rybolt. She jumped with the pack and was quickly checked out of the contest, relegating her to last. On her night, she is arguably the best greyhound to have gone around Rockhampton in the past 12 months.

Zulu Blast was very impressive over this track and trip last week. The one chink in his armour is he needs some space in the early part of races but with the smaller field and Box 8 he gets that optimum pattern here. He has opened up very short in early markets so I'm hoping he drifts on the Exchange come post time but he should still score a big win here.

Cain Bale got the job done last week as the Best Bet of the night and I'm going with him again.

Hector Fawley just doesn't seem himself in recent starts. I doubt I would Lay if he had Box 1 but from the dreaded Box 8 I just can't see him getting a clean run across.

Blue Ocean View has started his career off in tremendous fashion. The son of Fernando Bale has won seven of his 11 races with a further three placings. He was brilliant last week coming from well off the speed to beat 2023 Townsville Cup winner, More Peaches. He has raced solely in third-fourth grade at his past three starts and he gets a massive drop in grade here to what is seemingly a fourth-fifth grade race. Most of this field need to find the lead to produce their best while he can come from off the speed to win.",7. Blue Ocean View,0,2.641738679,-1,-1,0.609110337

Say Some Words returns to Rockhampton after finishing down the track in a heat of the Golden Oldies at Albion Park. Prior to this, she had won in BON figures at Bundaberg over the 531m. Despite this distance being 100m below her best, she has found an extremely winnable race. Many of her rivals are struggling to find their best and the dogs that are producing their best are only running moderate time for fourth grade standard. As long as she can get an unimpeded run out of the first turn, expect her class and strength to prevail.",8. Say Some Words,0,5.480513731,-1,-1,0.223188692

Lightning Buzz is having his first start in Rockhampton for new trainer Ken Boody. His form has somewhat taken a dive in recent starts potentially due to a few niggling injuries judging by the gaps between his runs. He doesn’t win out of turn only having won the five races from 30 starts albeit in harder company. The box draw is also against him with a notorious wide runner, Valentine Teddy coming into this race rising in distance drawn underneath him. Overall, it appears too sticky in all facets and I expect Lightning Buzz to be priced off his Brisbane form rather than his true winning chance in tonight’s contest.",6.
