Admittedly, I’m a massive fan of Care Factor; however, he is completely under the odds in this race. He’s proven to be ineffective chasing off the arm in fifth-grade company over the middle distance and is now stepping up to the staying distance. In theory he should settle closer to the arm; however, he meets a race that’s stacked with relatively hardened front-running stayers. He’d need to lead this race to even be a chance of winning but I can’t see him doing that. He won’t have the miles in his legs to run down these dogs just yet.

Chloe Ant has continued to improve with racing over the staying distance and she demonstrated that four starts ago running 41.71 in a heat of the Galaxy. She has followed this with three successive placings against the likes of West On Boonie and Penny Magic. Many of the runners in the market are cut from a similar cloth where they need to lead over this distance to show their best. They haven’t proven they can stalk and run down a dog capable of running around 42 even on the arm which Chloe is.

I want to speck Pepper Grinder here as I feel she’s the best stayer in this race.

I feel she hasn’t shown her best over this distance yet and I think she has a lot more box speed than she is letting on. She’s got a nice map here with Timon Lane in box eight unlikely to interfere with her and Zinc in box four capable of spearing out and pressuring Girl Hill. She could very easily come across and land in a prominent position and prove too classy late. Expect her to go to the next level this time in.

Victory Road would be one of the widest runners in the state which makes his box draw appeal. He returned off a two month hiatus last start, closing well for third behind Bergelmir who ran BON 29.69. Due to Victory Road’s wide running trait, it’s important for his races not to be won in 29.80-90 which gives him the chance to track into things. The only dog on paper who’s capable of running sub 30 is Bagnaia; however, with the amount of pressure drawn outside him, he won’t get it his own way. This should allow Victory Road to mind his own business out wide and make a dashing run around rivals down the back straight/turning for home.

Tricky race to figure out. Thought Sweetened returning from Listed level could prove hard to beat 3rd up. Form on paper in those races doesn’t look that good but the runs actually weren’t too bad. Draws wekll and will appreciate the class drop. The stablemate Sixteen Reasons is racing very well this time in.

Gotta Go Guru was sent out a $1.35 favoruite last start and while it took her the length of the straight to run down Ketchikan on a leader bias track there was plenty of merit in the win.

Wannaschmack beat home Gotta Go Guru two back but thought he was given a better ride. Was close up at Gawler last start too. Hasn’t put a foot wrong this prep.

Fortis In Armis was very good fresh then ran a credible 4th last time out when track conditions didn’t suit. He draws well here and has never missed the quinella in two attempts at Strathalbyn.
