Good quality novice race; however, Toss The Coin appears to have the most upside and extremely well boxed. The son of Dyna Double One was extremely impressive in his Rockhampton debut coming from off the speed to win in 23.82. He wasn’t seen for three weeks after this win and had no luck when finishing fifth behind Blake’s John. In both his starts, he has shown a tendency to run around the heels of rivals which suggests he wants to be drawn wide.

Dazzling Star appears extremely short in open markets. She has been racing in great form over the 407m; however, has never given the impression that she wants further. The only thing in her favour at this distance range is that she’ll run it the right way and that’s making your own luck leading. All the same, the kennel mate inside her, Magical Star has shown good box speed more often than not and has a tendency to run off a few lanes soon after box rise. 

Dazzling Star could easily get caught in trouble here and even if she did find an uncontested lead, she will have Riverina Knight parked on her backside coming home stronger.

Hoshino was heavily supported on debut in a heat of the Eric Thomson Memorial and dually saluted for punters defeating a key rival tonight in Cheers For Bella by one length. He was no match for Golden Bear in last week’s final who recorded a scintillating win in BON 29.85. To Hoshino’s credit, he weaved inside and out of runners to find the line in second position. 

He appears to have the most upside in this race and despite drawing box five, he should get room to move early with Cheers For Bella outside him likely to hold her line and Billie Cash Kid liking to angle towards the fence.

Just three runs back he defeated Nad Al Sheba by upwards of three lengths in a flying 29.35 over the Wentworth Park 520m. In his next two starts, he began on terms; however, he has been unable to find the lead with more speed drawn underneath him.

The 4 is becoming a cult hero amongst punters....for the place only!!! Bower just doesn't like to put races away although he has the ability to gap them at times. He's a great place bet again BUT he is a lay for the win. He's too short as you'll be holding your breath when he's bobbing next to the leader for the last 200m. In Bower We Trust.

Thought En Francais was terrific first up at Group 2 level when settle back and was sound through the line for 3.2L 5th behind Seonne. She’s a lightly raced 6 year old mare that doesn’t know how to run a bad race. Her 2nd up form is excellent and so is her track/distance stats. Looks a good rough chance. Jimmy Da Bear was very good fresh at Caulfield when charged home for 1.8L 4th. His 2nd up form is excellent and is a 3x winner from 6 starts at the mile. Chicago Storm has bounced back into form this prep with 2 very strong all the way victories this prep. Has always shown he’s up to this level. Reunites with last start jockey Carleen Hefel. Likely to lead again and prove hard to run down. Pounding was honest for 4th last time out as hot favourite when settled near last and charged home late. He drops in weight and gets the services of Blake Shinn here. Loves the mile being a 5x winner at the trip.

Steps up to 2000m which will suit, Jamie Kah aboard and meets Seonne better off at the weights. Seonne was a gutsy winner here last start over the 1600m. Gives the indication that the 2000m should be fine and Billy Egan and Patrick Payne have a great strike rate when they combine in Adelaide. Tycoon Bec was OK at Caulfield last start after getting squeezed at the start then wanted to over-race. She came home alright. That was her first run for 8 weeks so will strip fitter here.

Draws wide but should get back anyway and power home. Laced Up Heels comes across from Listed and Group racing in Perth. Hasn’t missed a place in 4 attempts this prep. Should go very close here. Grey River hasn’t had much luck with barrier draws but is still running very well this prep. Finally draws a gate here. Can break into the winners stalls again with even luck.

Amelias Jewel is the star horse of the race and deserved favourite. She's won a Group 1 race over 1800m but she is tractable over the Sprint trips. Tried her guts out in the $5 million dollar Quokka when just couldn't get past Overpass but was game for 2nd. She's the best horse in the race and gets to prove that here. Deserves to win another Group 1. Oscar's Fortune ran a brave 3rd behind Amelia's Jewel when William Pike saved ground along the fence and almost pinched it late. He's a young Western Australian horse on the rise and he does meet Amelia's Jewel 2.5kg better off at the weights. Benedetta ran well for 3rd in the Robert Sangster when 0.4L 3rd behind Climbing Star. Meets that horse now 1.5kg better off at the weights and Jamie Kah is a key engagement. Think the race is heading back across the border but Sghirippa and Extremely Lucky look the best of the local hopes. Johnny Rocker started $71 in the Group 1 William Reid and almost ran down the worlds best sprinter in Imperatiz. Then was close up in a G1 TJ Smith in Sydney.

Wasn’t suited by a track bias at Warrnambool last time out when settled back and made good ground when it was all over. Has a great record over this trip.

Glad they are finally putting a senior back on. Sir Kingsford is racing in great heart lately leading and winning his past two in dominant fashion. Will come across from the wide draw and prove very hard to run down. Building up a great record with Kayla Crowther in the saddle and is 1/1 at the front running favoured Parks circuit. Bond Street Beau had been racing in great heart before a last start flop when he missed the kick and was never really a factor after that. Draws to settle on speed here. Can bounce back.

Mystical Beck has found a lovely race to record her first win over the staying trip. She began brilliantly last start but was unable to lead Fahey’s Magic who has shown an electric turn of speed over the 600m which was only amplified over the 710m. To her credit, she stuck on gamely to run second in a personal best 42.30. She’s drawn superbly in box eight as she likes to use the track initially. With Garrison in box seven wanting to carve across to the fence, she is going to get plenty of real estate to zoom across and take control.

Another open race over the short course where a majority of this field could win with the right run. Waikarie Molly has opened on the skinny side due to winning her past two races from box eight. I think she’d be far better suited to an inside box draw as just about every dog can match her first section which could leave her in an awkward position. Despite having experience over the 520m, she isn’t a bitch with a booming finish so she could be vulnerable if she gets caught wide exiting the first turn.

Dance Sequence got her legs all wrong in the 1000 Guineas and seemed to jar up a bit. With some cut in the ground she's nicely poised to make amends here. Her form is better than it looks having finished in front of Kathmandu first up, who ran 2nd in the French 1000 Guineas. Buick was pretty soft on her late at Newmarket having travelled pretty close to the action throughout. With a colder ride she might have a better finish.",Dance Sequence,0,9.1,-1.00,-1.00,0.12

Secret Satire was good fresh when not fully fit at Sandown on a day that didn't suit her pattern. She then went on to win the Musidora at York with Francophone coming out and winning next start at Goodwood to frank the form.

Rubies Are Red was cranky pre-race and snagged back to last in the run. She took an eternity to warm up and get going but would have won easily with another 50 yards, having made up 13L on the winner after turning for home. This time they're going to make use of her better this time and I think she has and massive set of lungs on her for a sustained run. She'll be sent forward to make this a test and benefit Ylang Ylang who needs a tempo to aim at, but often we've seen the stable 2nd or 3rd string end up taking out the feature because they were ridden more positively and never missed the boat. If she does lead there should be a good chance to lay off at odds-on when she looks the winner.",Rubies Are Red,0,16.5,-1.00,-1.00,0.06

Balmacara chased home Zoum Zoum on debut with electric Dante winner Economics in 4th. Zoum Zoum made best use of the fast last along the fence and Balmacara didn't enjoy the savage kickback wider out as evident with him tossing his head about in the run. Once shifting to the rail he got organised and made up good ground on the winner and now he's come back as a 3yo winning twice with a better physique too. I fancy him to stalk Zoum Zoum all the way around and hopefully pocket him along the rail on the way to victory.",Balmacara,0,3.11,-1.00,-1.00,0.47
