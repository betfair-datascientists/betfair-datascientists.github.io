Admittedly, Sunset Serengeti has been in sparkling form winning the Mandurah Oaks and WA Oaks with ease. Despite these recent accomplishments, tonight is a new race and she appears to have her work cut out for her. There’s plenty of early speed engaged underneath her and I can’t see her getting across this field. She has only won one from five out of box eight and is far better suited to drawing lower where she can find the rail.

Hinto has been racing in superb order of late winning three of his past five starts. His form at Mandurah is second to none winning six of his eight starts with a further two placings. He’s exceptionally well drawn here in box one with West On Miley and Sunset Pepe both having enough speed to hold out his main rival in Sunset Hornet. The pair both get tired turning for home and like to use the track which is where Hinto will strike, railing hard underneath and coming home with a wet sail.

Streetcar Apollo was scratched from an easier race Wednesday in preference for this. First up just got too far back in the 900m scamper at Murray Bridge but hit the line nicely for 4th when the race was all over. Will take plenty of benefit from that. Draws to settle closer, handles the conditions and Kayla Crowther sticks the ride. Sportsbeat looks hard to toss after an excellent 4th at Flemington in a harder grade than this. Gets the services of Todd Pannell, drops back in class and is 1/1 at Morphettville. Wally West is a better horse than what he is showing this prep. Raced a bit keen last start and knocked up late in a tougher race than this. Drops in class and Jason Holder stays aboard. Worth another chance. Regal Dancer didn’t do much first up when hard in the market when settled back and was never a factor. Forgive that.",Streetcar Apollo,0,3.16,-1.00,-1.00,0.46

First Maid resumes from a spell and looks the one to beat here. Only career runs was smashed in betting ($12 to $5.50) and rocketed home from that tail for close up 2nd after being blocked for runs. The horse that won was called Aviatress. That horse has since gone on to run close up in Group races. Clearly thats a good form reference for a race like this. Trialed well. Should prove hard to beat. Sumambisstar was backed in from a long price and ran a cracking 2nd when getting home hard through the line. Will take benefit from the debut run, draws well and gets in with 51kg with the 4kg claim for Brook King. Blanc Visage has talent but was pretty disappointing first up when favourite behind Harja. That horse has since won again in town so the form from the race stacks up. They have made a host of gear changes for this. Best is good enough.

Probably just got too the front too soon and was vulnerable late. He's racing well and draws for a soft run. Like the booking of Jacob Opperman.

He was luckless last week on a heavy 9 surface but the expected conditions at Rosehill for Saturday’s meeting are much different. The track is currently rated a soft 6 without much rain forecast between now and race start, which isn’t ideal for this horse as his best form in Australia has come on very rain-affected tracks. The draw is sticky for him with speed drawn inside, and with the rail out six metres at this track, the most likely bias could be favouring horses that can find the fence in running. He will also meet his rivals from the Lord Mayor’s Cup worse at the weights, which he could overcome if he had conditions to suit, but it looks more likely than not that there is enough against this bloke for us to get him beaten.",Hopeful,0,3.90,0.34,-1.00,0.34
