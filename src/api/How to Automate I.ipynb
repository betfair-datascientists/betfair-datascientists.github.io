At the very end we will also create a script to simulate the exchange to backtest the strategies we have created so that we can optimize our stratgies. We will be using the [Flumine](https://github.com/betcode-org/betfair) package and all the code we create will be available on github so you can in your own models and strategies.\n",

    "Before we dive into the Flumine package or any code lets gain some understanding about the Betfair API. Betfair offers their API in two forms a Rest API and a Push API often call called as the polling api and the streaming api. We don't really need to know the technical differences between a Rest API and a Push API, but there are a few key differences on the Betfair API that is important to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rest API (Polling)\n",
    "- Only returns a snap shot of data, everytime you want more data you must make a new request and wait for a response\n",
    "- Contains all information such as runner name and any form data\n",
    "\n",
    "Push API (Streaming)\n",
    "- Only need to connect once, any updates will be sent to you as an update\n",
    "- Only contains some information such as prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Becuase streaming gives real time pricing information it is much better to than polling, but it doesn't include some key information such as the names of horses/sport teams. So the solution is to use both streaming and polling together. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are crazy and like to build everything from scratch feel free to work out how to use them together and to build out your betting infrastructure. But if you would like to remain sane the great thing about Flumine is that it automatically combines the two together so you get the betnefit of both real time pricing and also all the information provided in the polling API."
