# API Resources

There are a wide range of resources available to help make it easier to interact with the Betfair API, including those created by Betfair as well as the wider community.

Here are some of the resources we'd recommend taking a look at if you're building a program to interact with either the polling and/or Stream APIs. 

## The basics
- [Creating & activating your app key](/api/apiappkey)
- [Dev Docs](https://betfair-developer-docs.atlassian.net/)
- [FAQ](https://support.developer.betfair.com/hc/en-us)
- [Developer Program knowledge base](https://betfairdevelopersupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
- [Developer Forum](https://forum.developer.betfair.com/) where you can share your experiences and find out what's worked for other clients
- [Stream API](https://betfair-developer-docs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/pages/2687396/Exchange+Stream+API) where you can find an intro to the stream api

## Github
- Our Datascientists' repos for using [R](/api/apiRtutorial) and [Python](/api/apiPythontutorial) to access the API
- There's an ANZ [Betfair Down Under](https://github.com/betfair-down-under) community GitHub repo where you can find sample code, libraries, tutorials and other resources for automating and modelling on the Exchange, including an [Awesome List](https://github.com/betfair-down-under/AwesomeBetfair) and [Knowledge Share](https://github.com/betfair-down-under/knowledgeShare) with helper functions and guidance on best practice shared by the ANZ automation community. 
- [The UKâ€™s Github repo](https://github.com/betfair) including libraries for other languages

## Visualisers
- [Exchange Sports API visualiser](https://apps.betfair.com.au/visualisers/api-ng-sports-operations/) for testing market-related queries
- [Exchange Account API visualiser](https://apps.betfair.com.au/visualisers/api-ng-account-operations/) for testing account-related queries

## Other resources
- [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-betfair-api-and-how-to-use-it-e3cdbd79c94b) provide a decent basic walk through of how to log in to the polling API and pull market data, with some interesting commentary along the way.

!!! info "Betfair Quants Discord Group"
    `betfair quants` is really active Betfair-owned Discord group for people interested in modelling and automation on the Exchange. Please [reach out](https://forms.office.com/r/ZG9ea1xQj1) if you'd like an invitation. 

## New Zealand customers
**All requests to Betfair sites from IP addresses located in New Zealand must now call endpoints ending in '.com.au'** (requests to '.com' endpoints will be blocked).

All sites containing the url 'developer.betfair.com' do not currently have an active alternative 'developer.betfair.com.au' endpoint. This is currently being worked on being rectified by developers at Betfair UK.
In the meantime, New Zealand customers are advised to utilise a VPN or VPS with an Australian IP address to access these sites until further advised. 

Betfair apologises for any inconvenience caused.
