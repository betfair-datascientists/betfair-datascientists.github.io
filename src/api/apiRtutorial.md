# Betfair API tutorials in R

Betfair's API can be easily traversed in R. It allows you to retrieve market information, create/cancel bets and manage your account. Here's a collection of easy to follow API tutorials in R:

- [Accessing the API using R](/api/apiRtutorial/#accessing-the-api-using-r)
- [Get Worldcup Odds](/api/apiRtutorial/#get-world-cup-odds-tutorial)
- [AFL Odds PulleR Tutorial](/api/apiRtutorial/#afl-odds-puller-tutorial)

## Accessing the API using R

### Set up R

- [What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
- [Download and install R](https://cran.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) – get the language set up on your computer
- [Download and install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) – you’ll need a program to develop in, and this one is custom-designed to work with R

## New Zealand customers
**All requests to Betfair sites from IP addresses located in New Zealand must now call endpoints ending in '.com.au'** (requests to '.com' endpoints will be blocked).


### Required Packages

Two R packages are required:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(abettor)
```

The [abettor package can be downloaded here](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor). For an in-depth understanding of the package, have a read of the documentation. Instructions are also provided in the sample code.

---
### Login to Betfair

To login to Betfair, replace the following dummy username, password and app key with your own.

``` r
abettor::loginBF(username = "betfair_username",
                 password = "betfair_password",
                 applicationKey = "betfair_app_key")
```

If you don't have a live app key for the API yet [take a look at this page](../../api/apiappkey).

### Finding Event IDs

In order to find data for specific markets, you will first need to know the event ID. This is easily achieved with the [abettor package](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor). 

To find the event IDs of events in the next 60 days:

``` r
abettor::listEventTypes(toDate = (format(Sys.time() + 86400 * 60, "%Y-%m-%dT%TZ")))
```

This will return a DataFrame of the following structure:

``` r
eventType.id	eventType.name	marketCount
1	Soccer	1193
2	Tennis	2184
7522	Basketball	1
4	Cricket	37
7	Horse Racing	509
61420	Australian Rules	31
4339	Greyhound Racing	527
```

---
### Finding Competition IDs

Once you have the event ID, the next logical step is to find the competition IDs for the event you want to get data for. For example, if you want to find the competition IDs for Australian Rules, you would use the following

``` r
abettor::listCompetitions(
  eventTypeIds = 61420,  ## AFL is eventTypeId 61420,
  toDate = (format(Sys.time() + 86400 * 180, "%Y-%m-%dT%TZ")) ## Look ahead until the next 180 days
)
```

This will return the following structured DataFrame:

``` r
competition.id	competition.name	marketCount	competitionRegion
11516633	Brownlow Medal 2018	3	AUS
11897406	AFL	78	AUS
```

---
### Finding Specific Markets

The next logical step is to find the market that you are interested in. Furthering our example above, if you want the Match Odds for all Australian Rules games over the next 60 days, simply use the Competition ID from above in the following.

``` r
abettor::listMarketCatalogue(
  eventTypeIds = 61420,
  marketTypeCodes = "MATCH_ODDS", ## Restrict our search to Match Odds only, not other markets for the same match
  competitionIds = 11897406,
  toDate = (format(Sys.time() + 86400 * 60, "%Y-%m-%dT%TZ"))
```

This returns a large DataFrame object with each market, participants and associated odds.
