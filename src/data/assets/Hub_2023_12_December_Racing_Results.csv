Happy to pinch some petrol money here on Zipping Minaj who was brilliant on debut running 30.08, which was incredibly the best time ran throughout the entire meeting. This draw looks perfect for her right in line with the lure and she should explode the lids and lead all the way.

Johnny Football had a great draw and map when he won here in 30.19 but was still impressive when winning and has a ton of upside. He was thrown in the deep end last start at Sandown Park in a hot field and was no hope off the dreaded Box 8. This is a much better set up.Â

Dragon Inn does look well drawn in the red which should ensure his price stays short on the Exchange. But this is a deceptively deep race and most of this field could win this without surprising. Dragon Inn did win very well at Bendigo over 500 metres last start but he doesn't scream middle distance dog, in his runs at Ballarat over 545m he didn't hit the line as well as you would expect to be a good form reference for a race like this and I'm keen to take him on.

Not willing to Lay Amron Tiger but he does look too short in early markets. Lupini Monelli has now had two runs back from a spell. First up it appeared that she needed the run and last start was a much improved effort. She had wide draws on both occasions and looks stacks more suited to the inside here.

This is an outstanding race for a regular Free For All event. There are plenty of wide runners in this race with Tinker Norm, Mepunga Mustang and Transponder all likely to mid track. There could be some chaos on the first turn here if Tinker Norm jumps well and spears off at the turn.

Taking a small set against Zoha Bale here. This is plenty of pace to his outside with Get Ready Dora and Untapped near certain to cross him early. Valpolicella is also like to settle in front of him. If Zoha Bale gets buried back he has developed a habit of wanting to hook around dogs rather than rail underneath them.

Big Energy $1.85 (my assessed price) - is the dog of the moment. He is in the zone, he reminds me of El Grand Senor who won the Melbourne Cup in 2010. He hit peak form at the perfect moment and went bang and bang in the heat and Final. His heat run of 4.97 18.41 28.91 was simply astonishing as it was wet conditions on the night. If he replicates that run he simply wins this. I would never use the word Moral in a Melbourne Cup, and he is no moral as he will need to clear Mac's Damage off the mat, but this is a weak Melboune Cup overall and he looks a great bet even in red figures.

Get Carter has been racing in stellar form and he appears to be one of the best bets on the program. The son of Bernardo has finished in the quinella in his past eight starts including running second to Bear's Bullet by the smallest of margins in last month's Ipswich Cup. He got the better of Another Chance last fortnight winning by just under a length and the pair are set to clash again.

Bogie Hurricane appears to be over the odds in this contest. The son of Keybow dropped back to the 520m earlier last month to contest the rising stars where he finished fourth in the final behind Overflow Beau. He has since had two runs back over the middle distance and is set to peak third up. He got shuffled too far back last start where Blue Hornet was running some hot splits on the arm.

Hard to pot Blue Hornet on recent form over the 600m and he is arguably the fastest middle distance dog in the state. With this, bettors are forced to take rock bottom odds week in, week out for a dog who is a moderate box dog, needs luck and isn't the most genuine despite his record saying otherwise. He beat home both Springtime Gold and Baccarat Boy fair and square last week; however, now has to contest with box eight. Springtime Gold clearly headed him early last week and now drawing inside Blue Hornet, I expect her to keep him out. Add in literally every dog inside him capable of lid pinging on their night, I think he gets caught three wide working.

She does own the fastest personal best in this race and there's no doubt when she gets an uncontested lead she can reel off some sharp sectionals.

Flying Freda drops back to the 600m after a dominant display at her staying debut last week. She showed great muster early, found the front and quickly put at least eight lengths on the chasing brigade before holding on to defeat Disco Trixie by three lengths in a good 42.26. Generally, Iâ€™m not an advocate for dogs dropping back in distance; however, she maps too well here and has a class edge on this field. Flying Fredaâ€™s biggest weakness is outside pressure and with All About Coal a perennial slow beginner as well as Flashing Kuna, I just canâ€™t see a world where Flying Freda feels pressured unless she bombs the start. Capable of winning on or off the arm especially with that 700m run under her belt and I expect her to settle in the first two to three coming out of the first turn.",2.

Difficult program to find a lay prospect. Molfetta Drive is an obvious suspect for this section having only won one race from 26 starts including seven second place finishes. His lone win was over the 520m where he scored by an inch in a slow 30.60. Given his personal best is over eight lengths quicker than this run, itâ€™s safe to question his application. He comes out of the same form race as four other runners in this race where he seemingly pulled out of the contest before flashing late.

With all due respect to his rivals, this appears a slight drop in competitions and he maps supremely. Both West On Gecko and Aquila are patchy beginners who will hold their line while Molfetta Cruise and Minyong drawn outside both want to get off the track.
