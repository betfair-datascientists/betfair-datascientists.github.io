Despite jumping from the same box, he has an awful map with Duelling Banjos immediately outside him capable of matching him to the first mark and wanting to run off the track.

Storm Alert’s recent wins appear to be affecting his price too heavily. Despite following him in recent weeks it appears to be a good time to bet against him here as he is unlikely to get the run he requires to show his best. 

He isn’t a brilliant box dog; however, does muster well. The trick to him is finding the arm at the first post or around the 380m boxes. I don’t think he’ll get the chance to do that here with Wooden Hands wanting the rails outside him and Chloe Ant capable of running good splits early.

Wise Barra has started her career off in terrific order having won two from five with a further two placings. She was excellent, scoring from box eight three starts ago in Novice company over this track and trip in 29.99. 

She is well boxed in this contest with Silly Sally drawn inside her, unlikely to challenge her early due to dropping back from 600m and being a slow beginner.

Sunset Comanche is searching for the hat-trick on Saturday night. The son of Hard Style Rico has won his past two races over track and trip both from box six. He has been able to circle fields and finish off strongly. 

His map appears good tonight with the kennelmate, Sunset Tyson likely to begin fast and give him a nice cart into the race.

Staying benchmark races aren't usually my go but Herman Hesse profiles as well as you can for a race of this nature.

He dropped back to 2000m, it was an extremely fast run race and I thought the effort to keep grinding was outstanding. Fourth-up, runs under the belt vs both Monbaher and Grand Promenade who are only second-up coming off a slowly run 2040m race and Fearentless dropping back from 3000m with a gap between runs.

By general rule, Inside Scoop has been an “inside box” dog, however; his last start effort was extremely concerning. He missed the kick hopelessly from box two and upon looming underneath the leading pack, he ran off the track for no specific reason. This is one of the worst traits a dog can possess and once they do it once, they can make it a habit. With early pressure expected from Uncle Tommy and Bunji Man, this trait could leave him in a world of pain.",Inside Scoop,0,5.27,0.23,-1.00,0.23

Care Factor stepped up the middle distance four starts ago when getting himself in trouble on the first turn. With all things considered, his run was enormous as he conceded many lengths and was able to finish off well. He has had two “get fit” runs over the 520m where he has run second to Gimli and Vander Harley who are both in good form. Expect him to race on or near the speed and prove too speedy down the back. Has the assets to be a sneaky good 600m dog and one to follow through the grades.

Good free-for-all contest where Bunji Man can come away with the gold medal. He was a touch unlucky last start when beginning well and being squeezed out of the early battle due to the sheer speed of Crumble Monelli. He doesn’t have to compete with Crumble Monelli in this race and he should get a nice cart into this race from Uncle Tommy who appears the likely leader exiting the first turn. From there, he can comfortably track Uncle Tommy and nab him late when he’s most vulnerable.

Palawa King didn’t have the best preparation going into the Zoom Top last week but I thought it was a sensational run without much luck mid race and he hit the line powerfully.

Al’s Entity needs space early in his races and then he explodes as evidenced by his slick win over 650m at Shepparton.

Simply Express has started his career off in great fashion having won two of his four starts. Both these victories have come at Capalaba and he looked new at Albion Park last Thursday having his first public hit out. He jumped poorly; however, mustered hard to contest the lead before being run off on the first corner and down the back straight. He finished off the race well considering he was chasing a 29.83 winner who recorded the fastest time of the night. 

He’s well drawn in box seven with Howdy Hope inside likely to head to the rails and City Steamer outside likely to hold her ground. Expect Simply Express to get the clean air he desires and put in a good performance.

2 is a short course rocket and now steps up to the 520m. It's not the strongest of races and may get away with it but at an odds on quote, I've got to take her on. A few other short course animals engaged which might make it tricky in the first 50m. She obviously needs to lead to win but the last 50m will be a struggle. 4 might get the gun run in behind the early pace.

Savic has caught the eye late in the piece in his past two runs over the 652m at Mandurah. He appears well suited stepping up to the 715m at Cannington and he was quite unlucky in his only start at this track when getting checked multiple times.

Admittedly, Dusty Deluxe beat home Couch Surfer fair and square last week; however, he is being overvalued in current betting. He started a $9.50 chance while Couch Surfer was $1.40. One win by a margin of 0.75L shouldn’t be enough to adjust his price from $9.50 to his $2.50 opening price. 

There’s more pressure in this race with Hurricane Taylor likely to push outside and try to find the front. Add in a potential bout of second up syndrome, Dusty Deluxe appears severely overvalued.

Victory Road makes the step up to the 600m in the hope he can jump to the lead and iron out his bad trait of running wide. It’s almost laughable how wide Victory Road has been running recently as he has literally scraped paint off the outside fence in his past few starts.

Kanan Stark has made a hot start to his career having won seven of his 13 races. Since returning to the 520m at Cannington, he has recaptured his best form scoring two wins on the bounce. He showed great box manners to cross from box seven three days ago to lead and fend off the strong

Morton was sensational in his semi final win running a blistering 29.53. The map looks the key to this event.

Succeed holds the key to the race here, if he begins well and finds a forward spot he will likely start pulling up and race next to the leader without going past.

I wish Piccolo Bale drew closer to the rails but I still like him anyway. He has a bright future, has good race sense and should be strong in the closing stages. We are just relying on getting around the first turn unscathed but could mean a bigger price.

Utrillo Bale looks to have plenty of upside and I love the way she has improved each start. She ran an impressive 29.70 which was her first start on a city track. I could see her improving again on the clock and that should be good enough to win this event.

Canya All Class looks impeccably drawn here from the inside, he has star potential and has been running some insane run home times. In addition, with every start he is learning how to begin better and become more reliable. The only slight concern is avoiding a bump with Motion Sensor in the early stages but he really should be winning this.

Hector Fawley has had no luck in his last two starts. These starts have been a semi final of the Australian Cup and the G1 Rookie Rebel. This looks exponentially easier. The inside draw and smaller field should suit him to a tee and every box looks ticked.

Big Yeti is having his first go over 595m which looks a negative in a city class race. Box 6 is no help and on top of that there are some wide runners drawn around and they can race unpredictably. I can see Big Yeti finding early trouble and running out of gas late.
