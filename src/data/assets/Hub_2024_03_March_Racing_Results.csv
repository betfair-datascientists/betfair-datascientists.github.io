Admittedly, Zipping Neutron is a talented greyhound who has a brilliant record; however, he appears tested tonight and has opened extremely short in betting.

Admittedly, Bunji Man's recent form has seen a decline, he now faces what could be his easiest race in quite some time, presenting an excellent opportunity for a rebound. In recent weeks, he has been competing in open grade or free-for-all against the likes of Transponder and Sunset Frazier. However, in this upcoming race, he drops back to fourth and fifth-grade, where he stands out as the only fifth-grader. The race setup plays into his favour, with Lady Dior positioned outside, a known slow starter, and a vacant box three.

After returning from a two-month break two starts ago, he triumphed over this track and trip, setting a personal best of 30.24.

Sunset Tyson enters this race on the fresh side having run over the 400m at Mandurah last Friday. He appears to get his birthday set up here with two dogs dropping back from the 600m drawn inside him, a vacant box outside him and Coulter Bale in box six capable of stepping and holding out the only other speed factors in the race, Go Seek Kotoni and Daddy’s Girl. He should muster hard here, lead and zoom away from rivals heading down the back.

Admittedly, Window Shopper was brilliant last week and defeated Girl Hill fair and square. This week is an entirely different race complexion with Girl Hill jumping from box three while Window Shopper has box eight. She showed the week prior that she can hold him out when drawn inside him and he has an awful map to overcome with Maxwell Smart jumping up to the 600m for the first time capable of beginning and he has shown a liking to use the track around corners. Expect Girl Hill to cross Cravina Kuna with ease and get no pressure from Timon Lane outside.

Happy to take a set against Sunset Pepe. He is far better suited to an inside draw and I don’t think he handles himself well from wide box draws as he often looks to use the running rail as a guide. He hasn’t proven he can win from off the speed in this grade and I can’t see him crossing Wise Barra early considering she is more than capable of producing a sub 5.50 first section. He was unable to run down Sunset Nightjar from a similar position to what he’ll get on Saturday night and I’d argue Wise Barra is stronger than Sunset Nightjar. Vander Harley appears to be the forgotten runner and presents nice value.

Taking on the last fav of the night. Has his box and is flying (talking myself out of it!) but not sure he can lead. 4 crosses the inside three and finds the early lead. 5 gets a good map. 6 is class with a capital C but after saying all that my on top selection is the 7. If he had box 8 I'd be very confident. He's absolutely flying, loves an outside draw and brings cracking form into this. He could SP double figures.

Taking on the fav here. Although trialled well this is his first race start here tonight and he's no guarantee to lead. 1 went like a torpedo last week, 2 has great pace on his night and 6 and 7 can really go when they get the start right. 3 can win but he'd need to lead and I'm risking that. The bet in the race aside from the lay might be the 8 to run a place. His will to win isn't real high but racing against the better dogs might see him just do enough to land on the podium

Heat 4 of the Egg and I'm on the QLD visiter in box 7. This race doesn't have a lot of early pace and 7 and 8 look the early leaders.

REBEL'S ROMANCE has completed 8 races on turf, winning 6 of them. He bounced back to form in a big way when dancing clear by 3L in Doha last time. He'll have been primed for this and he wants even tempo rather than a brutal gallop or a crawl, and that is what we are likely to get here.

LAUREL RIVER is a solid each way play here and I don't mind the wide gate as long as he can cross to lead. He made a sustained early burst from barrier 14 last start to skip out in front, never looking like getting beat at any point in the race. Total unknown at the trip, but could be a menace leading all of the way at odds, especially if he can pinch another 5L break on the bend. His cruising speed is electric.

This horse seems to be the heir apparent to Kyprios. His dry track form is outstanding and he was charging home late last start to win at the Saudi Cup meeting.

5u liability lay on Saudi Crown here. Meydan has different dimensions to Riyadh and if Saudi Crown runs the same race he won't win here despite this being significantly weaker.

SIGHT SUCCESS was the best of the near-side runners last year, finishing 4th but the first of his group. It was a rare occurrence of the wide barriers being slower than the inside barriers and only three horses drawn inside 6 have won this race since its inception. I'd love for the far side runners to run a separate race to the near side as I believe the stand's rail is the A1 position. It's not likely to be the case though as the pace is all drawn low.

STAR OF MYSTERY is a much better horse than this lot and only the barrier beat her last time. She was rocketing home past the field and only had Frost At Dawn on the other side of the track who had pinched 4L ahead of her. This is extra distance which will test the legs of the numerous 1000m types in this field but also the sharpness of the 1400/1600 American and Hong Kong runners.

GEORGE TESORO is going to bounce out and attempt to make all, much like his compatriots last year.

He is a tough on-pacer/front-runner and from the inside gate he is going to be in the thick of the action. He conquered Remake two starts ago and that horse has come up half the price and favourite for this off the back of his Saudi win, despite drawing poorly.

Only fair through the line when getting a soft run in transit last start over 2600m, this race has a lot more depth and from the wide draw will give the leaders a big start coming into the final 600m of the race. ",Prickley Prince,0,8.2,0.138888889,-1,0.138888889

Osman tackles this first up from a 14 week spell. It was a very nice trial here over the 1010m at Orange on the 24th of March. We have Stapleford claiming 2kg and running at the home track expecting to show something first up.",Osman,1,6.44,5.44,5.44,-1

Water Lad last start was at Muswellbrook on the 15th of March. This was its first ever race start with no public trial for 10 months. Jumped well from the wide barrier and dragged back to last on the fence. In the straight the jockey decided to use the cutaway which on the day was slower ground. It has done an amazing effort to finish in 2nd place from that position of running. Gets up in trip here a soft barrier and positive jockey change. Looks his day to break his maiden.",Water Lad,1,2.96,1.96,1.96,-1

This horse has had a stable change from John O’Shea to Cameron Crockett. It has a 25 week spell from its last start with O’Shea. Lonhro’s Queen trialed on the 6th of March at Muswellbrook against a horse called Gentileschi which it broke its maiden with style on the 22nd of March at Scone. Jumps from
Barrier 1 in this race and should be very hard to beat.

Resumes from a spell and I am happy to risk first up over this trip. He has some strong form lines over 1400m however based on where he ended up last prep he is likely being prepared for middle distance races and I feel he will be better placed once stepping up in trip. This looks a good race for The Jester's Son to break his maiden as the second horse from the last start has since gone on to win.",Gawnski,1,5.08,-1,4.08,-1

Rubi Air last start was in the Country Championship Qualifier at Coonamble on the 17th of March. On this occasion it was one of the best horses to jump out of a wide gate and was dragged back through the field to find cover. Around the bend it was one of the widest runners working. Once balanced up in the straight it had a battle with Gallant Star in the straight and wasn’t disgraced in this quality race only getting beat 4L. Come back here to BM58 from a class 5 hoping that S Llewellyn can settle closer in the run and should be too good.",Rubi Air,0,4.87,-1,-1,0.258397933

Place Bet. We’re taking a bit of a risk here given its resuming without trials but I think the favourites 2 and 3 are both too short and 5.

Very short in the early markets and he deserves to be after an impressive last 600m figure was produced last start.
