[Schwert (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1574010203010240) suggests that many of the market anomalies, discovered in financial markets as a contradiction to market efficiency, disappear once they have been published in academic literature. So, although these researchers may have found the existence of a favourite-longshot bias in betting markets in the early 2000s, they likely no longer exist as the publication of their findings leads to an increase in market efficiency.\n",

Luckily, the [Betfair documentation](https://docs.developer.betfair.com/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Betting+Type+Definitions#BettingTypeDefinitions-Runner) provides everything we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Betfairlightweight` and `Flumine` wrapper for the Betfair API, `runner` has the attribute `last_price_traded`, so to access it we can simply call `runner.last_price_traded`.

As Python starts indexing rows from 0, instead of 1, we will be selecting the 0th index to get the value of the first row.

    "We also need a way to validate bets so that we don't bet on multiple selections. This is because process_market_book will run every time anyone places or cancels a bet on that market. So we need to prevent multiple bet placements. This is usually easily done by setting `max_trade_count = 1` however, looking at the [documentation](https://github.com/liampauling/flumine/blob/0f12a0f9d200b4a4c36c8bd26c9f4fbe82f8cce1/flumine/strategy/strategy.py#L70) we can see that this is only on a per selection basis. As the favourite horse can change over time then we may end up betting multiple times if the favourite changes. In most situations this probably isn't an issue, as you can just limit betting to a timeframe e.g., from 60 seconds before the jump to 50 seconds before the jump. However, if the market is very illiquid there may not be any bets placed or cancelled in the time frame. So, let's come up with a way that our strategy can only bet once without using the timeframe as a work around.\n",
