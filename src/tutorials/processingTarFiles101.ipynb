    "### 1.6 The Good Stuff\n",
    "Now comes the really meaty chunk of code that will do the grunt work for us. We'll generate the timestamped prices for each TAR file separately and then loop over them again to generate the selection metadata. (This is using a chunk of code from our JSON to CSV Revisited tutorial using the Betfair_Data package. This is super speedy because its mainly written in Rust rather than python)\n",
    "In our metadata files we will provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market ID\n",
    "- Market Time\n",
    "- Country Code\n",
    "- Track/Venue\n",
    "- Market Name\n",
    "- Selection ID\n",
    "- Horse Name\n",
    "- Result\n",
    "- BSP\n",
    "- Preplay Minimum Matched Price\n",
    "- Preplay Maximum Matched Price\n",
    "- Preplay Weighted Average Matched Price\n",
    "- Preplay Last Traded Price\n",
    "- Preplay Matched Volume (not including SP volume)\n",
    "- BSP Matched Volume (Back Stake)\n",
    "- Inplay Minimum Matched Price\n",
    "- Inplay Maximum Matched Price\n",
    "- Inplay Weighted Average Matched Price\n",
    "- Inplay Last Traded Price\n",
    "- Inplay Matched Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For markets that don't go in play (like Greyhounds/Place markets), the 'Inplay' fields will be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this metadata generation, we'll then join the dataframes together and add the \"seconds to scheduled off\" field, as well as converting the GMT time in the TAR Files to Melbourne time (this is useful for when markets are timed for early morning before 10am (or 11am during daylight savings) which causes the local event date to be the previous day in GMT) and converting the currency to Australian Dollars using a historical currency conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final piece will be outputting the files to CSV. The code is setup to output a separate file for each race which reduces the number of rows per race and enables output to be easily opened and checked for completeness. Changing this to output one CSV file per TAR file or one CSV file per day is fairly straightforward."
